Technologies we used:
1.	Kitty, 0.74.2.3 version.
(KiTTY is a fork from version 0.71 of PuTTY, telnet / SSH client.)
•	Telnet is a network protocol that allows a user to communicate with a remote device.
•	SH is a network protocol used to remotely access and manage a device.
•	The key difference between Telnet and SSH is that SSH uses encryption, which means that all data transmitted over a network is secure from eavesdropping.
