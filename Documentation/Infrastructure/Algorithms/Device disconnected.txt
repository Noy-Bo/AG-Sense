Algorithms:
1. Device disconnected.
The algorithm located in the Disconnected class.
Description:
Algorithm used to report disconnected devices (device that didnâ€™t report/send a msg for x mins at least).
in this algorithm we use HashMap where the key is the imei of the device and the value is the HashSet containing.
Example for x=2:
We use 2*6+1 HashSet in HashSet array which represents a time fragment (the first HashSet is 0 secs then 10 secs until 120 secs).
we run one main thread ReportTimer to shift the HashSets and to report disconnected, and run a new thread every time we get a msg from a specific device to swap when was the last time we received a msg to 0 secs(first HashSet).
