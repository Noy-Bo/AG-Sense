Refresh feature

there is a refresh feature that was added to the application, whenever you are on a page 
like notification or device view or whenever data is displayed to you you can pull down 
from the top of the page and the page will refresh, when refreshed the app will request new
data from the server, each request has a x- second timeout till we request the same request 
again.

this number can be changed in cache manger.
