Flow:
when an activity (usually setting) want to send a SMS to device it need to define a couple
of parameters.
	- what responses expected to receive for conformation of send SMS.
	-phone number pf device
	-handler for when all SMS are received 
	-type of setting.
from these prams we create a new tracker, the tracker is stored in SMSMgr .
The activity sends SMS to Device using special function :

	public void sendMsg(String phoneNumber, String message) 

	this function takes a phone number and a message and send that message to the phone number
	the number need to be Internationale format with "+"  sign.

and then we create a tracker specific to the SMS sent.
when an SMS is received it is processed through SMS receiver and a specific tracker is invoked to 
update its SMS list, once list is empty it invokes handler and signals SMSMgr to delete itself.
