Push notification Feature

Description:
When ever a device has a critical issue the server send a notification to the accounts associated 
with the device.

Description of Class and functions:

	TokenRegistrationHandler:
					Description:
					class responsible for registering the user with its device to the Firebase database


Flow:
when the user  first logs in successful  we will register that user with a device identifier using the 
TokenRegistrationHandler class to the Firebase server.
whenever the is a need for a notification, the server team check who the device associated
with the notification is connected to (which accounts) when the server send a signal to 
the Firebase server to send a notification, the code responsible for manual notification is 
in backEnd project located in the same repository.

there is two option for sending a notification:
-send to one person
-sending to multiple people


when the user logs out, we remove the device and user account pair from the Firebase database
so that that phone wont receive notification related to that used.


REQUIRE FIXING:

- on "backend", right now we send a firebase-notification, wherein we actually need to send a data-payload message (this will cause the push-notifications to arrive even upon application-killed-mode!).
	-we can solve it within "backend" code.

- need to handle the registration of tokens better: as of now, only the device who last-logged to a specific account/admin will receive push-notifications.
	- we can solve it by changing the structure of the Firebase-DB we use (eg. Firestore) to hold the accounts/admins tokens and also adjust the way we register new tokens to the DB from the client-code(on TokenRegistrationHandler).

- after applying the 2 aforementioned fixes, we need to adjust within the "backend" code, the way we send data-payload-messages: 
	- to a single account/admin (meaning we need to send to multiple devices associated with that account/admin).
	- to multiple accounts/admins (again, to multiple devices associated with these accounts/admins).

- adjusting the notification-design which is shown on the phone screen - the code for this should be applied within "OnMessageReceived" overriden method (located on client code).
