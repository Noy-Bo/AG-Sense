This activity uses Google Maps API to display devices at their geographical location.

The activity also uses Googles clustering library to join close markers to one cluster icon, making the map cleaner and easier to understand.

Has three uses, according to the op-code passed to the activity:

1. When op-code = 1, the activity will display all devices passed to it, in their last updated location, with the ability to search for a specific device in the entire map.

2. When op-code = 2, the activity will display the complete timeline of a devices passed to it. Between every consecutive marker a line will be drawn to indicate the movement of the device, each point on the map will display a timestamp of when that message was recieved from the device.

3. When op-code = 3, the activity will display only the last location of the device passed to it, and the user will need to define a geofence for the device. The device's location need to be inside the geofence. the user need to long press to define two points , those two points represent two oppossit  corners  of a rectangle and that defines the geo fence of device. 

Entities:

-Place : A serializeable class which also implements ClusterItem to use in clusters. Has two field for Latitude and Longitude, and also two fields for the title and a short optional snippet.

-UserMap : A serializeable class containing an ArrayList<Place> for all the markers that need to be displayed on the map.
